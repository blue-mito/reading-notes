# Class Four - Reading Assignment

## Ken Lindsay

### So, here's what we covered in the fourth reading assignment':' 

- **HTML  4: Links**
- **HTML 15: Layout**

- **  JS  3: Functions, Methods, and Objects**
- **Article: [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)**

#### The HTML code was particularly interesting as I am learning more about how elements in a webpage, that I would take for granted, operates. My favorite part of the LIST chapter was the use of id tags to move to a particular section of a webpage! Being used to long lists of content and being able to jump to that particular article, it made a lot more sense as to how it worked'!'

#### The LAYOUT chapter introduced me to the display of webpages on various machines. Clearly using a fixed pixel dimension for a webpage can give you control of exactly how it will look... on one display. The idea of dynamically reacting to the user's preferences, or simply writing everything in terms of percentages, really highlights the large amount of work that goes into something so intuitive that we only notice when it goes wrong'.'

#### Then, we went onto Javascript, focusing primarily on Functions and methods. This was interesting as I was able to see the foundations of automating a process at a basic level. A simple analogy would be to receive an address, and then format it for printing onto an invitation. You could start with an input into the function, and the result would be an output reflecting the input. Note: I'm short on code examples for this assignment, but hope to list more as we get deeper into the course'.'

#### Finally, Pair programming was particularly interesting, as I typically am used to coding on my own. The prospect of having the insight of another as we dynamically created the project sounds like a great idea! I was able to get some insight to  this during the Code Lab portion of 21 FEB 2022, wherein I assisted one of my accountability partners with their nested for loops and logic for Lab 3. It was interesting, as I assisted with them as they shared their screen and we walked through their code. Rather than simply back-seat driving, we were able to bounce ideas as to which flows would work best and why they would addess the problem. While not the same as that listed in the article, it did present the possibilites of this coding style. I look forward to seeing it in action'!'
