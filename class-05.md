#### What I found interesting about this reading assignment was the need to accomodate older versions while trying to incoporate new features. In images, the use of low resolution graphics to allow for faster load times was an interesting strategy. The use of HLSA vs HLA as a means of incorporating transparency in those browser that could use it, while having a a redundant mechanism in place for those that do not, was really eye-opening. It is becoming clear that there will need to be a lot more strategy in planning and deploying a website, so that it is accessible to all varieties of user experiences. I am curiosu to see what will come up next'!'
