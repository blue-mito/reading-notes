#### The Blog posts were quite relateable and reminiscent of previous experiences that I had. In my last gig, I was speaking to a bunch of scientist that knew I could help them with a problem they had, using some coding skills I had. There immediately was a disconnect, where we needed to really understand the workflow to make progress. With that came the frustrating part where we needed to review our assumptions for further exceptions or ways that programs could break. It was a real learning experience, as we both learned that coding can accomplish many things, may, seem magical, but is very particular about details. '!'
