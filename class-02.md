Class Two - Reading Assignment

So, here's what we covered in the second reading assignment:

HTML  2: TEXT
HTML 10: CSS
JS    2: JAVASCRIPT
JS    4: LOGICAL OPERATORS

In general, I am still becoming accustomed to the need to specify with text has specific formatting through CSS. Writing in the text formatting as you go, seems like the simplest path. However, as the section on CSS notes: this can make your life much simpler if you have multiple pages. By having simple rules and themes that each page must stick you, a brand or theme is created, where every instance of a particular rule is followed without you have to write in the foramtting for every word, in every sentance, in every page.

For instance, I found that headings had a lot more to do with priority that merely size of page elements.
As an example: <h1> would indicate information of foremost priority. This really allows for these heading distinctions to specify content layout rather than merely a place holder for font characteristics. By creating a CSS file with the following:
h1 { font-family: MS Trebuchet, color: grey}
I've effectively controlled the h1 elements for all webpages referencing the same CSS file! Therefore, I need only alter the CSS file to make changes across the entirety of the webpage, allowing for control and consistency. A marvelous improvement.

Of course, additional information was obtained on Javascript elements, of which I am familiar, but I will save that for a later date. For now, I am interested in taking notes of style elements that I enjoyed learning about:
<br /> is a favorite of mine, as it allows for line breaks and  the wrapping of text in alerts and similar comment fields can create text layouts that annoy me. A minor inconvenience, to be sure, but a persistant one that I can now be rid off!
<em> </em> is particularly useful for providing emphasis, typified by italicized text for the designated section. However, my like the header elements, CSS allows one of go above an beyond that! Change the font, the font-size, the color! Make it really emphasize what you are looking for!
and finally, <s>
Ever wanted to display something with a line through it? That comical half-thought or mis-fire? This tag allows for that.
Websites with personality. 
Nice.
